This guide walks you through the process of creating a "hello world" Configuration Server and client service.

== What you'll build

You will enable support for Spring Cloud Config Server and build a client app that will read configuration properties from the server.

== Configure the Spring Cloud Configuration server

The Pivotal Cloud Foundry Marketplace offers the Spring Cloud Configuration server as a service for providing externalized configuration for your various applications and services running on PCF.

. Select the "Spring Cloud Configuration Service" from the Marketplace:

You have completed the setup for a Spring Cloud Configuration service. This service can now be used to provide centralized configuration to a client application running on Cloud Foundry.


== Utilize the configuration in a client app

== Summary

Congratulations! You've just enabled centralized configuration and utilized that configuration from within a client application.
